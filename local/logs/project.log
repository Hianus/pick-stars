2019-07-17T09:51:50.848Z - warn: Please change the definition of property 'jumpAudio' in class 'Player'. Starting from v1.10,
properties in CCClass can not be abbreviated if they are of type RawAsset.
Please use the complete form.
For example, if the type is Texture2D, the previous definition is:
    jumpAudio: cc.Texture2D,
Now it should be changed to:
    jumpAudio: {
