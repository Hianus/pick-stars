2019-07-18T01:24:48.318Z - warn: Please change the definition of property 'jumpAudio' in class 'Player'. Starting from v1.10,
properties in CCClass can not be abbreviated if they are of type RawAsset.
Please use the complete form.
For example, if the type is Texture2D, the previous definition is:
    jumpAudio: cc.Texture2D,
Now it should be changed to:
    jumpAudio: {
      type: cc.Texture2D // use 'type:' to define Texture2D object directly
      default: null,     // object's default value is null
    },
(This helps us to successfully refactor all RawAssets at v2.0, sorry for the inconvenience. ðŸ˜° )
2019-07-18T01:24:48.318Z - warn: The default value of Player.jumpAudio must be an empty string. (changed since 1.8)
